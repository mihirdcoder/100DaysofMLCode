# 100DaysofMLCode
log.md has a daily updates and info about work I have done on that day.
Update: I moved from India to US for my master's. I took ML intensive courseworks so have not got time to do side projects and I can't push my assignments,project (which are ML,data sciecne intensive) work here before the end of semester. So I have stopped this challenge. :)

# 100DaysofMLCode
This i my repo for # 100DaysofMLCode challenge by Siraj.
I am starting at beginner stage and from the joureny of this challenge I hoping to increase my knowledge.

Day 1 (https://github.com/mihirdcoder/100DaysofMLCode/commit/4622291c27f3a30ee9ded0f9ba39d0b10aed53b0): 
    I am starting with numpy 101 exercise.(https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/101-numpy-exercises-python/) I completed     with 50 fo those exercises.
Day 2 (https://github.com/mihirdcoder/100DaysofMLCode/commit/973102a5f4f923f16c42f70088c26392d379569f):
    Attended a meetup of Machine Learning forundation pune on introduction to tensorflow. Coded a sample Convolutional Neural       Network (Conv2D) using tensorflow for MNIST dataset. Not pushing that code on repo now because I have not completely           understood it completely. When i will digest it completey I will push it here.
    From Andrew Trask's website coded and understood 2 layer and 3 layer simplest feed forward NN. Coded it using Numpy. Gained     more insights about backpropogation.
    Also scraped few webpages for project I will be working on.
Day 3 and 4: (https://github.com/mihirdcoder/100DaysofMLCode/commit/dec0f0b1143b626a5acb2eeb16f25d9bb0f13c48)
    Honestly I havent worked a lot. Been Lazy and I regert.
    It is not like I havent studid for 1 hour, I probably given more than one hour but I was not that much productive.             Complited numpy problems from that website. Did few code of gradient descent havent posted here yet because not understood     clearly. Will post soon.
    I am making note to myself that I will post everyday. And weekly I will be writing an article on my medium page.
Day 5-6 :(https://github.com/mihirdcoder/100DaysofMLCode/commit/d8c14bddc6dc21e9feace7006e4719643e85fae1) Commited all stuff            done completely. Lot of stuff is still incomplete. Went more deep into theory. SGD is becoming more complex have to            refer simple resorces. Till tomorrow at least basic mnist classifier has to be done. New task for next 3 days is                compliting 101 pandas problem.
